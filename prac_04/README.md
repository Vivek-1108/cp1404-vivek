## 1. Lists Warm-Up
**File:** `lists_warmup.py`  
**Description:**  
This program demonstrates basic list operations in Python. It includes:
- Predicting the output of various list expressions.
- Verifying predictions by running the code.
- Modifying lists using indexing and slicing.

**How to Use:**
- Run the program to see the results of list operations.
- Modify the code to experiment with different list expressions.

## 2. Accountant Annie
**File:** `total_income.py`  
**Description:**  
This program calculates cumulative monthly income totals. It asks the user for the number of months, collects income inputs, and displays a formatted report showing the monthly income and cumulative total.

**How to Use:**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of months.
3. Input the income for each month.
4. View the generated income report.

Example:
```
How many months? 3
Enter income for month 1: 1000
Enter income for month 2: 1500
Enter income for month 3: 2000

Income Report
-------------
Month  1 - Income: $   1000.00 Total: $   1000.00
Month  2 - Income: $   1500.00 Total: $   2500.00
Month  3 - Income: $   2000.00 Total: $   4500.00
```

## 3. Subject Reader
**File:** `subject_reader.py`  
**Description:**  
This program reads data from a file (`subject_data.txt`) containing subject details, processes it into a list of lists, and displays the subject details in a formatted manner.

**How to Use:**
1. Ensure the file `subject_data.txt` exists in the same directory as the program.
2. Run the program to see the formatted subject details.

Example `subject_data.txt` file:
```
CP1401,Dr. Smith,120
CP1404,Dr. Brown,95
CP1801,Dr. Green,80
```

Output:
```
CP1401 is taught by Dr. Smith and has 120 students
CP1404 is taught by Dr. Brown and has 95 students
CP1801 is taught by Dr. Green and has 80 students
```

## 4. Basic List Operations
**File:** `list_exercises.py`  
**Description:**  
This program performs two tasks:
1. Basic operations on a list of numbers, including finding the minimum, maximum, and average values.
2. A security checker that verifies if a username is in a predefined list.

**How to Use:**
- **Part 1:** Enter 5 numbers when prompted to see the calculations.
- **Part 2:** Enter your username to check if access is granted.

Example:
```
Number: 10
Number: 20
Number: 30
Number: 40
Number: 50
The first number is 10
The last number is 50
The smallest number is 10
The largest number is 50
The average of the numbers is 30.0

Enter your username: jimbo
Access granted
```

## 5. List Comprehensions
**File:** `list_comprehensions.py`  
**Description:**  
This program demonstrates the use of list comprehensions in Python. It includes examples of:
- Squaring numbers.
- Filtering even numbers.
- Finding numbers divisible by 3.
- Converting strings to uppercase.

**How to Use:**
- Run the program to see the output of each list comprehension.

Example Output:
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
[3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48]
['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']
```

## 6. Quick Pick Lottery Generator
**File:** `quick_picks.py`  
**Description:**  
This program generates "quick pick" lottery tickets. Each ticket contains 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45, displayed in ascending order. The user specifies how many tickets to generate.

**How to Use:**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of quick picks you want.
3. View the generated lottery tickets.

Example:
```
How many quick picks? 3
 5 12 18 22 35 44
 1  3 15 23 30 45
 2  8 19 25 34 41
```

## Git Repository Maintenance
To maintain this repository properly:
1. **Commit Frequently:** Commit changes after completing each program with meaningful commit messages.
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Completed lists_warmup.py"
   ```
2. **Use Branches:** Create a new branch for each feature or program.
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/total_income
   ```
3. **Push Regularly:** Push changes to the remote repository.
   ```
   git push origin feature/total_income
   ```
4. **Document Changes:** Update the `README.md` file whenever new programs are added.
