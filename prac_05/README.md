## Instructions
### Running the Programs
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd practical_05
   ```
3. Run the desired program using Python:
   ```bash
   python state_names.py
   ```

### GitHub Workflow
- Each program is developed in its own branch (e.g., `prac_05_feedback`).
- Changes are committed frequently with meaningful messages.
- Pull requests (PRs) are created for code reviews before merging into `master`.

## Code Review Process
- Request a code review by mentioning a reviewer in the PR description (e.g., `@username`).
- Reviewers provide feedback via comments on the PR.
- Authors address feedback by making changes and pushing updates to the branch.
