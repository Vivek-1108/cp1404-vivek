# Practical 07
# Programming Languages CSV Reader

A Python program to represent programming languages, read their details from a CSV file, and display them in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- Defines a `ProgrammingLanguage` class to represent programming languages.
- Reads programming language data from a CSV file.
- Automatically creates a sample CSV file (`languages.csv`) if it doesn't exist.
- Displays details of each programming language in a readable format.

## Files in the Project

- `programming_language.py`: Defines the `ProgrammingLanguage` class.
- `language_file_reader.py`: Reads the CSV file, creates `ProgrammingLanguage` objects, and displays their details.
- `languages.csv`: A sample CSV file containing programming language data (automatically generated by the program).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Ensure both `programming_language.py` and `language_file_reader.py` are in the same directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python language_file_reader.py
   ```

## Expected Output

When you run the program, it will:

1. Create a sample CSV file (`languages.csv`) with the following data (if it doesn't already exist):
   ```
   Name,Typing,Reflection,Year,PointerArithmetic
   Python,Dynamic,True,1991,False
   Java,Static,True,1995,False
   C++,Static,False,1983,True
   Rust,Static,False,2010,False
   D,Static,True,2001,True
   ```

2. Display the following output in the terminal:
   ```
   Sample CSV file 'languages.csv' created successfully.
   Programming languages loaded from languages.csv:

   Python, Dynamic Typing, Reflection=True, Pointer Arithmetic=False, First appeared in 1991
   Java, Static Typing, Reflection=True, Pointer Arithmetic=False, First appeared in 1995
   C++, Static Typing, Reflection=False, Pointer Arithmetic=True, First appeared in 1983
   Rust, Static Typing, Reflection=False, Pointer Arithmetic=False, First appeared in 2010
   D, Static Typing, Reflection=True, Pointer Arithmetic=True, First appeared in 2001
   ```

## Code Structure

### `ProgrammingLanguage` Class

- Represents a programming language with attributes:
  - `name`: Name of the language.
  - `typing`: Typing style (e.g., "Static" or "Dynamic").
  - `reflection`: Whether the language supports reflection (`True` or `False`).
  - `year`: The year the language was created.
  - `pointer_arithmetic`: Whether the language supports pointer arithmetic (`True` or `False`).
- Includes a method `is_dynamic()` to check if the typing style is "Dynamic".
- `__str__()` provides a readable string representation of the language.

### `language_file_reader.py`

- Reads data from `languages.csv` using the `csv` module.
- Converts each row into a `ProgrammingLanguage` object.
- Displays all programming languages in a user-friendly format.

## Troubleshooting

- **FileNotFoundError**: Ensure both `programming_language.py` and `language_file_reader.py` are in the same directory.
- **Python Version Issues**: Ensure you are using Python 3.x.
