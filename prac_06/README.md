## Overview
Practical 06 focused on implementing and testing the concept of classes in Python. It was an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Through this practical, I worked on creating multiple classes, managing relationships between objects, and testing their functionality.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **Class Implementation:** I learned how to implement classes with attributes and methods, ensuring they align with real-world objects.
- **Encapsulation:** I understood the importance of encapsulating data and providing controlled access through methods.
- **Inheritance:** Although this practical didn't explicitly require inheritance, I reinforced my knowledge of how it can simplify code reuse.
- **Dynamic Typing:** By implementing the `ProgrammingLanguage` class, I explored how dynamic and static typing affects programming languages.
- **Testing:** Writing test programs for classes helped me understand the importance of validating class behavior.

## Challenges Faced
- **Designing Classes:** Initially, I found it challenging to decide which attributes and methods each class should have. For example, determining whether attributes like `fuel` or `odometer` should be public or private required careful thought.
- **Testing Edge Cases:** Ensuring the `drive` method in the `Car` class handled cases where the fuel was insufficient was tricky. I had to test various scenarios to confirm the method worked correctly.
- **Vintage Guitar Logic:** Implementing the logic to determine whether a guitar is vintage required careful handling of dates and conditions.

## Achievements
- Successfully implemented and tested all required classes (`Car`, `ProgrammingLanguage`, `Guitar`).
- Created reusable and extensible code by following best practices for class design.
- Gained confidence in writing test programs to validate functionality.
- Improved my ability to debug and handle edge cases effectively.

## Future Improvements
- **Inheritance:** In future projects, I would like to explore how inheritance can simplify class hierarchies, such as creating a `Vehicle` base class for `Car`.
- **Error Handling:** Adding error handling to methods (e.g., ensuring valid input for `year` or `fuel`) would make the code more robust.
- **Unit Testing:** I aim to use Python's `unittest` module to write formal test cases for my classes.

## Conclusion
This practical was highly beneficial in strengthening my understanding of object-oriented programming. By working on real-world examples like cars, programming languages, and guitars, I gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing classes. I am confident that these skills will be valuable in future programming tasks.
